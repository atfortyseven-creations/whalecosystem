 * Each market has its own FPMM contract address returned by Gamma API as `market_maker_address`.
 *
 * Trade Flow (2 transactions):
 *   1. approve(fpmm_address, amount) on the USDC contract
 *   2. buy(investmentAmount, outcomeIndex, minOutcomeTokensToBuy) on the FPMM
 *
 * Contracts:
 *   USDC on Polygon: 0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174
 *   FPMM address:    Per-market, from Gamma API field `market_maker_address`
