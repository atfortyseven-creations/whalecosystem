              At Whale Alert Network, security is not an afterthought or a compliance checkbox — it is the fundamental pillar upon which our entire architecture is built. We understand that in the realm of decentralised finance, the integrity of data and the protection of user assets are absolutely paramount.
            </p>
            <p>
              We employ a defence-in-depth strategy, combining cutting-edge cryptographic protocols, a strict zero-trust operational model, and continuous third-party auditing to ensure that our platform remains resilient against emerging threats. This document outlines the exhaustive measures we take to secure our infrastructure and protect your digital sovereignty.

              While we engineer our systems to be resilient against all known attack vectors, we maintain a highly structured Incident Response Plan (IRP) to address potential zero-day vulnerabilities or systemic anomalies rapidly and effectively.

              In the event of a severe security incident, our protocol mandates immediate transparency. Users will be notified through all official channels within 24 hours, accompanied by a preliminary technical post-mortem and actionable guidance to protect their assets. We believe that hiding vulnerabilities is a greater risk than the vulnerabilities themselves.
