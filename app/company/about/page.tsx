          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-[1.75] text-black/70">
            <p>
              Whale Alert Network was founded with a simple, profound realisation: the technological tools and market analytics used by professional traders and large financial institutions were vastly superior to those available to everyday users. Moreover, the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, while promising absolute transparency and democratisation, was becoming increasingly complex, fragmented, and fraught with security risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              A specialised group of passionate software engineers, financial analysts, and user experience designers came together to bridge this growing gap. We set out to build a holistic platform that strips away the daunting complexity of blockchain technology, presenting users with a clean, intuitive, and highly professional interface that rivals the best consumer applications in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result is a comprehensive Web3 dashboard that seamlessly integrates nine core modules — including the Humanity Ledger (a real-time on-chain scanner and private portfolio tracker) and Whale Chat (end-to-end encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging) — accessible across devices via a frictionless, cryptographically secure QR-code session synchronisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              From our early days developing simple portfolio trackers, we have rapidly evolved into a comprehensive global ecosystem. Today, we offer real-time market analysis, secure end-to-end encrypted communication channels, advanced asset management tools, and institutional-grade charting — all packaged into an accessible web application. Our fundamental commitment to never compromising on user privacy has guided every architectural decision we have made since day one.
            </p>
            <p>
              We maintain 100% operational status across our distributed node infrastructure with zero reported outages, demonstrating a proven track record of shipping complex features without compromising security or uptime.

              Whale Alert Network is entirely <strong>Open Source</strong>. We believe that true financial sovereignty and privacy can only be achieved when the underlying code is fully transparent, auditable, and verifiable by the community. We do not commercialise the system; our goal is to provide a robust, production-ready public good for the decentralised ecosystem.

              We are deeply integrated with the <strong>Aztec Network</strong>, a programmable zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup. By leveraging Aztec’s Noir circuits and confidential execution environments, we obscure sensitive user interactions:
